# Machine Learning with Python

## Project Overview
In this project, the goal is to cluster customers based on their information. We have a dataset containing information such as gender, age, score, and income for each customer.

## Clustering Methods Used
I employed three clustering methods to analyze the data:

1. **DBSCAN**
2. **KMeans**
3. **Hierarchical Clustering**

Each of these methods offers different insights into the clustering patterns within the dataset.
